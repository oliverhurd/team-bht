# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/mnrxwetebu4gqgx4oy9cud)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Clerk keys:

```bash
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

The frontend only needs the publishable key; the secret key is for any server-side use.

### Deployment
Connect this GitHub repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and define the
following environment variable in the Vercel dashboard under **Project Settings • Environment Variables**:

- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - your Clerk publishable key

Then deploy; Vercel will run `npm run build` and host the static site. `ClerkProvider`
is already configured in `src/index.tsx` so auth will work out of the box.
